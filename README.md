# Advent-Of-Code-2022

This is a little repo of Jon's [Advent of code
2022!](https://adventofcode.com/2022)

> 📝 They won't all be perfect by any means as I'm just doing it for fun! 🎅❄️🎄

## Running scripts

While doing this advent calender of code I actually use
[quokka](https://quokkajs.com/) to see results as I'm working 👍.

However, to run a script [tsx](https://github.com/esbuild-kit/tsx) is also set
up as a super quick typescript runner without any of this build nonsense. So for
example to run the script for day 1 use:

```bash
pnpm tsx ./day1_elves-and-calories/main.ts
```

> 💡 You will need [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed globally... alternatively use your package
> manager of choice! 👍
